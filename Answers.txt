10) since Thermometer and PitotTube class is a subclass of TemperatureConverter which implements the interface Converter
interface and this Converter interface has its own method convert so, the property of that interface comes to the
Thermometer and PitotTube class. So, we can access the convert method with Thermometer and PitotTube class instances.

11) Though Converter interface holds an object of Thermometer or Thermocouple , Converter doesn't know about isHot or
isFast because this methods are properties of Thermometer not the property of Converter. For that same reason isFast fails
too.

12)Since Converter object is type casted to its subclasses like Thermometer etc. so, object type changes to that subclasses.
So, it now can call its own defined methods. so, isHot and isFast works fine.
